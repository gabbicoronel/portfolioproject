# portfolioproject
As of now, just a landing page for BGS Surf Supply & Coffee Bar. Their current site throws a lot of information at the user which takes away from what I beleive should be the end goal, sales (coffee or surf supplies). I intend to simplify the site. Starting with the landing page. Here, there are less choices for the user to make in the Nav bar. While also keeping the interactive, surf/skate culture present. Users will get to select from  coffee, surf, or community tab that will take them to designated pages.
